The Music world aimed to provide users with a seamless music streaming experience similar to the original platform.
The design emphasized creating a visually engaging music player interface, customizable playlists, and advanced contentdiscovery features.
Special attention was given to integrating audio visualization and playback controls for an immersive listening experience.
Like the Netflix clone, the Spotify clone was designed to be fully responsive and adaptable to different screen sizes and devices.
